<br />

I'm Nathan 🤓 a self taught developer with most of my experience lying in back end 💻. 

I have an avid interest in back end technologies including web servers, databases and API creation & interaction. I'm passionate about learning 💡 and always enjoy the challenge of learning about, and implementing new technologies in projects. 

After the last few of years travelling ✈ and learning to code 👓, I'm now trying to progress my journey in the tech world and work with forward thinking companies on exciting and challenging projects 🙏.
